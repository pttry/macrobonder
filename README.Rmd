# macrobonder

The goal of macrobonder is to provide simple funtions to read data from
the Macrobond.

The macrobonder depends on the MacrobondAPI. To install the MacrobondAPI


## Get data from macrobond

There are two functions to get data from the Macrobond:

* `get_md()`, simpler and faster method to get whole series with same frequency.
* `get_convert_mb()`, a method with more options to get also series with
   different frequency. Series are converted to same frequancy.
   
Series are returned as a data.frame.

```{r example_get}
library(macrobonder)

x <- get_mb(series = c("usgdp", "figdp"))

str(x)

```

```{r example_get_convert}

y <- get_convert_mb(series = c("usgdp", "uscpi"), frequency = "Annual")

str(y)

```
